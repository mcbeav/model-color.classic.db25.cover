# Color Classic DB25 SCSI Cover

Model to cover the DB25 SCSI connector on the logic board. It was designed to go along with my custom Color Classic Mystic back panel to prevent the custom DB19 floppy connector from potentially shorting. It doubles as a nice handle to grab to pull the logic board from the case. It fits very snug around the connector, and stays put.
